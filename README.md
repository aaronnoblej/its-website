# ITS Solution Center Website
This is a project made in my web design class, where my group and I were able to develop a website for the Concordia College ITS Solution Center. It consists of a graphical front-end for the user, as well as a database management interface for site administrators (contents found in the 'admin' folder). My personal responsibilities included back-end programming using PHP, mainly on the admin section of the site, contact page, and work order page.

**It should be noted that this website was developed for use on a DNS that is no longer active, so many of the links will not work and the database configuration is no longer valid.**
